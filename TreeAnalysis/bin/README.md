This directory is supposed to contain the executables for the multi boson analyses.
Right now the package produces the following executables:

- ```vvxAnalysis``` --> example, not supposed to be modified.
- ```zzwAnalysis``` --> QGC analysis, pp --> ZZW --> 4l2j
- ```zzsAnalysis``` --> VV scattering analysis, pp --> ZZjj --> 4ljj
